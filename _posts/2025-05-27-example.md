Heathens is a multi-issue graphic novel I’ve been working on independently since 2020.
With over 200 pages complete, I’m in the process of finding a publisher for book 1, while working on book 2.

> A girl born in a closed religious society attempts to escape through forbidden magic. When her spellcraft accidentally burns down the capitol church, she becomes the poster child for revolution in the region. Heathens takes a fantastical and introspective look at the religious family dynamic, and their matrilineal patterns of abuse and suppression.
